# Summary

The `quadkeyr` R package presents a comprehensive toolkit for 
generating raster images from Quadkey-Identified data 
within Microsoft’s Bing Maps Tile System [@bing-maps].
Designed to integrate Quadkey-Identified data into R workflows,
this package facilitates the creation of QuadKey grids and raster images and
introduces specialized functions for 
the processing of Facebook Mobility data [@data4good]).

The goal of `quadkeyr` is to:

1.  [**Convert a QuadKey to a Simple Features data.frame (and more):**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_to_sf_conversion.html) 
`quadkeyr` provides functions to convert QuadKeys
to a `sf` POINT data.frame or `sf` POLYGON data.frame [@sf]. 
Additionally, it offers all the R functions 
described in the official documentation [@bing-maps]
for converting QuadKeys to and from tiles, pixels, and geographic coordinates.

2.  [**Generate Raster Images from Quadkey-Identified Data:**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_identified_data_to_raster.html) Complete a grid of QuadKeys within a specified area and zoom level, 
and create a `stars` raster [@stars]. 
You can also directly convert QuadKeys in a data.frame column 
into an `sf` POLYGON data.frame.

3. [**Convert Facebook Mobility QuadKey-Identified Datasets into RasterFiles:**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/facebook_mobility_csvs_to_raster_files.html)
Convert Facebook mobility data `.csv` files into `.tif` files by day and
hour reported.

4. [**Offer an App for visualizing QuadKeys on a map:**](https://docs.ropensci.org/quadkeyr/articles/quadkey_visualization_app.html)
Introduce a QuadKey visualization application 
enabling users to validate function outcomes.

# Statement of need

## What are QuadKeys in Tile Maps?

Tile maps divide the Earth’s surface into a grid of tiles, 
with each tile corresponding to a specific geographic area 
at various zoom levels.

QuadKeys represent a location on a map by encoding
its hierarchical spatial position
as a sequence of characters \autoref{fig:fig1}. 
They provide an efficient method to address and retrieve specific map tiles, 
facilitating rapid display within mapping applications.

## QuadKeys, tiles, pixels and geographic coordinates

Tile maps are composed of pixels that are grouped into tiles. 
Later, the tiles are converted to QuadKeys to optimize map performance, 
among other benefits described in detail 
in the official documentation [@bing-maps].

![Pixels (0, 0) and (2047, 2047) for a map with zoom level 3. Image extracted from Microsoft’s Bing Maps Tile System webpage \label{fig:fig2}](vignettes/bing_pixel.jpg)

Pixels and tiles are expressed as two-dimensional coordinates,
(`pixelX`, `pixelY`) and (`tileX`, `tileY`),
but QuadKeys are one-dimensional numeric strings. 
This is important to understand how the conversion works.

Each geographic pair of coordinates (latitude/longitude) 
will belong to a specific pixel referenced by coordinates (`pixelX`, `pixelY`)
for each zoom level. 
In \autoref{fig:fig2}, you can see pixels (0, 0) and (2047, 2047) 
for zoom level 3. 

![Tile coordinates. Image extracted from Microsoft’s Bing Maps Tile System webpage. \label{fig:fig3}](vignettes/bing_tiles.jpg)

For instance, a pixel for zoom level 3
represented by the coordinates `pixelX = 255` and `pixelY = 12` 
is part of the tile with coordinates `tileX = 0` and `tileY = 0`. 
The pixel with coordinates (0,0) belongs to tile (0,0), 
and the pixel (2047, 2047) is part of tile (7,7). 
You can verify this by comparing \autoref{fig:fig2} and \autoref{fig:fig3}.

## Converting QuadKeys to and from tiles, pixels, and geographic coordinates

The conversion from QuadKey to geographic coordinates
involves a series of smaller transformations that relate to 
the structure of Tile Maps. All of these intermediary functions, 
as well as those facilitating the reverse conversion, 
are available for use within the `quadkeyr` package.

There are different tools in Python, R and other programming languages 
that help to convert Quadkeys to tiles, pixel or geographic coordinates as well. 
The package `slippymath` [@slippymath] is the sole package
in the R ecosystem dedicated to analyzing tile maps. 
Despite some similarities 
between `quadkeyr` and `slippymath`, 
both packages were developed with different objectives.

The goal of `quadkeyr` is 
to provide a new tool to facilitate the analysis of Facebook Mobility data, 
so it has specific functions tailored for this purpose
and is based solely on the Microsoft's Bing Tile Maps documentation.
On the other hand, `slippymath` is a mature and smaller package 
with general tools for analyzing tile maps.
It was designed to be easily incorporated as a 
dependency of higher-level tools.

## Raster Images

Recent changes in the geospatial R ecosystem 
such as the deprecation of [@rgdal], [@rgeos] and [@maptools],
affected packages that relied on them, as [@sp] and [@raster],
which have recently ceased being updated. 
[@rspatial-evolution-1;@rspatial-evolution-2]
The `quadkeyr` package addresses this issue 
by adopting the more modern R `stars` package [@stars], 
which converts the `sf` POLYGON data.frame provided as input 
to a `stars` object [@stars].
This object can then be saved as a raster image.

## Facebook mobility data and Data for Good

Meta provides datasets in their program Data for good 
that are QuadKey-Identified, 
such as the citizen mobility dataset [@data4good].
To facilitate the processing of these data,
`quadkeyr` offers specific functions 
designed to analyze the `.csv` files 
by date and hour provided and generate `.tif` raster images 
using no more than three functions.
So far, we are not aware of any other package
that provides these functionalities.
